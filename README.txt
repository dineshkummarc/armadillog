

Welcome!

Armadillog is a web console log. It makes it easier and faster to sift through application logs etc.
Input a file or a piece of text, apply a set of filters and examine the result.
You can narrow the output down to the point where you see exactly what is relevant to your current need.

It's still a work in progress, so please feel free to send me any bug reports or feature requests.
