

Welcome!

Armadillog is a web console log. It makes it easier and faster to sift through application logs etc.
Input a file or a piece of text, apply a set of filters and check out the result.
You can narrow the output down to the point where you see exactly what is relevant to your current need.
Input files are automatically being followed - constantly checked for modifications so the console is up to date.

It's still a work in progress, so please feel free to send me any bug reports or feature requests.
